# Z-Engine
A game/graphical application engine written by Zachery Visger. 
This version is mostly meant to be used as a prototype for Z-Engine becomes a C++, OpenGL/Vulkan/... engine.

For now, this will use python with pygame and pyopengl to create a simple game engine. Undecided if we want to limit ourselves to 2D or 3D, but for now we will be focusing on 2D.
